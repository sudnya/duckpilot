Issue: Potential Memory Leak
CID: 1008
Type: Resource leak
Severity: Medium
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_atpx_handler.c
Line: 144 (return statement)

Description:
The function amdgpu_atpx_call allocates memory for buffer.pointer using ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER, but does not free this memory in all code paths. Specifically, when the function succeeds (i.e., when acpi_evaluate_object does not fail), the allocated memory is returned to the caller without being freed.
Code Path:

acpi_evaluate_object is called with ACPI_ALLOCATE_BUFFER
If the call succeeds, the function returns buffer.pointer
The caller of amdgpu_atpx_call becomes responsible for freeing the memory, but this is not clearly communicated

Explanation:
This is a potential memory leak because if the caller of amdgpu_atpx_call is not aware that it needs to free the returned pointer, the allocated memory will never be released. This can lead to gradual memory consumption over time, especially if this function is called frequently.
Recommendation:
There are two potential approaches to fix this issue:

Free the memory before returning and copy the data to a caller-provided buffer.
Document clearly that the caller is responsible for freeing the returned pointer, and ensure all callers comply.

Given the existing structure of the code, option 2 might be more suitable. This involves adding clear documentation and ensuring all callers of this function free the returned pointer.
