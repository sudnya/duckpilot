Issue: Potential Buffer Overflow in sprintf

CID: 1003 (example Coverity ID)
Type: Buffer Overflow
Severity: High
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_atombios.c
Line: 147

Description:
The function sprintf is used to write to the buffer stmp without any length checking. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the formatted string exceeds the size of stmp.
Code Path:

Function 'amdgpu_atombios_i2c_init' is called
Inside the loop, sprintf is called at line 159: sprintf(stmp, "0x%x", i2c.i2c_id);

Explanation:
The buffer stmp is declared with a fixed size of 32 bytes. The sprintf function writes to this buffer without any bounds checking. If i2c.i2c_id is unexpectedly large, it could result in writing beyond the end of the stmp buffer, causing a buffer overflow.
Recommendation:
Replace sprintf with snprintf, specifying the buffer size to prevent overflow. This ensures that the function will never write more characters to the buffer than it can hold.
