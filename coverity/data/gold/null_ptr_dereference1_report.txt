Issue: Null Pointer Dereference
CID: 12345
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_cs.c
Function: amdgpu_cs_parser_init
Line: 46
Type: NULL_RETURNS
Severity: High
Status: New
Description:
The function 'amdgpu_cs_parser_init' dereferences 'cs' without first checking if it is NULL. This can lead to a null pointer dereference if 'cs' is NULL when the function is called.
Code Path:

Function 'amdgpu_cs_parser_init' is called with 'cs' as an argument
'cs' is dereferenced at line 6 without a NULL check: if (cs->in.num_chunks == 0)

Potential Impact:
If 'cs' is NULL, dereferencing it will cause a segmentation fault or system crash, potentially leading to denial of service or system instability.
Recommended Fix:
Add a NULL check for 'cs' at the beginning of the function:

if (cs == NULL) {
    return -EINVAL;
}

static int amdgpu_cs_parser_init(struct amdgpu_cs_parser *p,
                                 struct amdgpu_device *adev,
                                 struct drm_file *filp,
                                 union drm_amdgpu_cs *cs)
{
    if (cs == NULL) {
        return -EINVAL;
    }

    struct amdgpu_fpriv *fpriv = filp->driver_priv;

    if (cs->in.num_chunks == 0)
        return -EINVAL;

    // ... rest of the function ...
}

Notes:

This issue occurs in a critical path of the GPU command submission process.
Similar checks should be considered for other parameters (p, adev, filp) if they are not guaranteed to be non-NULL by the calling context.
The fix will improve robustness but may slightly increase function complexity.
