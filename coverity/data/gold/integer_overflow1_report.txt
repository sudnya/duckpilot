CID: 2001
Type: Integer Overflow
Impact: High
Status: New
Description:
An integer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the function amdgpu_read_bios_from_rom. The issue occurs when calculating the length of the BIOS to be allocated. The function uses the AMD_VBIOS_LENGTH macro to determine the initial length, then aligns it to 4 bytes using the ALIGN macro. This sequence of operations could potentially lead to an integer overflow, resulting in a smaller allocation than intended and possible buffer overflow when reading the BIOS.
Location:
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/amdgpu_bios.c
Function: amdgpu_read_bios_from_rom
Line: [line number where len = ALIGN(len, 4); occurs]
Code snippet:
len = AMD_VBIOS_LENGTH(header);
len = ALIGN(len, 4);
adev->bios = kmalloc(len, GFP_KERNEL);

Potential consequences:

Memory corruption due to buffer overflow
Potential for arbitrary code execution
System instability or crashes

Recommendation:
Use unsigned integer types for length calculations and check for potential overflow before performing operations that could cause overflow. Additionally, implement a maximum size check to prevent unreasonably large allocations.
