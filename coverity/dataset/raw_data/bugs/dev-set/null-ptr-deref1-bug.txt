Category:   Error Handling Issues

Impact:     High

Description:
------------
A potential null pointer dereference issue has been identified in the `amdgpu_gem_object_create` function. If the `amdgpu_device *adev` or `dma_resv *resv,` is NULL, accessing members of these structures without validation may lead to 
undefined behavior and potential system instability.
