Issue Type: BUFFER_OVERFLOW

Description
Buffer overflow in __encode_table_record_to_buf() due to unchecked buffer boundaries before memory operations. The function performs multiple sequential writes to a buffer without size validation, potentially leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
Technical Details
Path 1
Copy-> Function: __encode_table_record_to_buf
   Line 123: memcpy(buf + i, &tmp, 8)
   * No buffer size validation before memory operation
   * Variable 'i' can be 2 at this point
   * Writing 8 bytes at offset 2 without bounds checking

-> Function: __encode_table_record_to_buf
   Line 127: memcpy(buf + i, &tmp, 6)
   * No buffer size validation before memory operation
   * Variable 'i' can be 10 at this point
   * Writing 6 bytes at offset 10 without bounds checking

-> Function: __encode_table_record_to_buf
   Line 134: memcpy(buf + i, &tmp, 6)
   * No buffer size validation before memory operation
   * Variable 'i' can be 18 at this point
   * Writing 6 bytes at offset 18 without bounds checking
Events

Function receives unconstrained buffer pointer
No size parameter is provided
Multiple memcpy operations performed without bounds checking
Total write operations exceed potential buffer size
No error handling for buffer overflow conditions

Risk

Memory Corruption: Potential to write beyond buffer boundaries
System Stability: May cause system crashes or undefined behavior
Security: Could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

Fix Recommendations:
Verify remaining space before each memcpy:
