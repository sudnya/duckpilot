Issue: Potential Buffer Overflow
Type: Buffer Overflow

Line: 463

Description:
A potential buffer overflow has been detected in the function gfx_v9_4_2_wait_for_waves_assigned(). 
The function uses a fixed-size buffer of 256 bytes to store a formatted string, but does not implement proper bounds checking. 
This could lead to a buffer overflow if the accumulated string length exceeds the allocated buffer size.
