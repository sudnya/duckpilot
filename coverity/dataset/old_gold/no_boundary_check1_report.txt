Issue: Lack of Boundary Checks
CID: 2003

Type: BUFFER_OVERFLOW
Severity: High
File: drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/si.c
Line: 1324
Description:
The function si_read_bios_from_rom lacks proper boundary checks when reading data into the bios buffer. The function calculates the number of dwords to read based on the input length_bytes, but it doesn't verify if this calculated length exceeds the actual allocated size of the bios buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing memory corruption or security vulnerabilities.

Snippet:
dw_ptr = (u32 *)bios;
length_dw = ALIGN(length_bytes, 4) / 4;
/* set rom index to 0 */
WREG32(mmROM_INDEX, 0);
for (i = 0; i < length_dw; i++)
    dw_ptr[i] = RREG32(mmROM_DATA);

Impact:
A buffer overflow can lead to undefined behavior, including:

Memory corruption
System crashes
Potential security exploits

Recommended Fix:

Add a parameter to specify the actual size of the bios buffer.
Implement a boundary check before the read operation.
Return an error if the required read size exceeds the buffer size.
